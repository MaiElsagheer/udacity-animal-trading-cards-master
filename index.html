      <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes him a fabulous family pet, and his intelligence makes him a highly capable working dog.

They’re also natural athletes, and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.(Wikipedia)</p>
